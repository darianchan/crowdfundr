Design Exercises

Smart contracts have a hard limit of 24kb. 
Crowdfundr hands out an NFT to everyone who contributes. 
However, consider how Kickstarter has multiple contribution tiers. 
How would you design your contract to support this, without creating three separate NFT contracts?

To do this, we could have each NFT tier associated with different metadata. 
This metadata could contain things such as artwork in variying degrees.
To implement this, we could use the full ERC721 token with that has access to methods that allow storing metadata on chain.

Everytime someone contributes to our campaign and the contribute() function gets invoked, we could have a mapping of 
their address => tier. And once we call the mint function, we would mint an nft with the specific metadata that is associated
with ther contributor's tier.
